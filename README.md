# 📝 To-Do List App

This is a simple and interactive To-Do List web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. The application allows users to add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them—all in real-time without any page reloads. It demonstrates the fundamentals of DOM manipulation and dynamic UI updates using JavaScript, making it a great project for beginners looking to understand how front-end logic works.

The user interface is clean and minimalistic, with a responsive layout that works well on desktop devices. Each task appears as a list item, and users can mark tasks as completed by simply clicking on them, which toggles a strikethrough style. A delete button is also provided for each task to remove it from the list instantly. This project does not require any external frameworks or libraries and runs purely on client-side code.
